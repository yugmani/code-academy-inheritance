  <h1>Classes</h1>
  <h2>Inheritance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When multiple classes share properties or methods, they become candidates
      for inheritance — a tool developers use to decrease the amount of code
      they need to write.
    </li>
    <li>
      With inheritance, you can create a parent class (also known as a
      superclass) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also
      known as subclasses) share.
    </li>
    <li>
      The child classes inherit the properties and methods from their parent
      class.
    </li>

    </li>
    <li style="background-color: lightgray">
      <p><code>class</code> childClass <code>extends</code> parentClass{</p>
      <p>&emsp;<code>constructor</code>(properties){</p>
      <p>&emsp;<code>super</code>(properties);</p>
      <p>&emsp;<code>this.</code> = properties;</p>
      <p>&ensp;}</p>
      <p>}</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      The <mark><code>extends</code></mark> keyword makes the methods of the
      parent class available inside the child class.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <mark><code>super</code></mark> keyword calls the constructor of the
      parent class. In this case, super(properties) passes the properties
      argument of the child class to the constructor of the parent class. When
      the parent constructor runs, it sets
      <code>this._properties =properties;</code> for new child instances.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a <code>constructor()</code>, you must always call the
      <code>super</code> method before you can use the <code>this</code> keyword
      — if you do not, JavaScript will throw a reference error. To avoid
      reference errors, it is best practice to call super on the first line of
      subclass constructors.
    </li>
    <li>
      Child class may have unique properties and set it to the child
      constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      When we call extends in a class declaration, all of the parent methods are
      available to the child class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Since the <code>extends</code> keyword brings all of the parent’s getters
      and methods into the child class,
      <code>childClass.property</code> accesses the <code>property</code> getter
      and returns the value saved to that property.
    </li>
    <li>
      In addition to the inherited features, child classes can contain their own
      properties, getters, setters, and methods.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Benefits of Inheritance</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The benefits (<em>time saved, readability, efficiency</em>) of
          inheritance grow as the number and size of your subclasses increase.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you need to change a method or property that multiple classes
          share, you can change the parent class, instead of each subclass.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
