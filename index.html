  <h1>Classes</h1>
  <h2>Inheritance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When multiple classes share properties or methods, they become candidates
      for inheritance — a tool developers use to decrease the amount of code
      they need to write.
    </li>
    <li>
      With inheritance, you can create a parent class (also known as a
      superclass) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also
      known as subclasses) share.
    </li>
    <li>
      The child classes inherit the properties and methods from their parent
      class.
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>class</code> childClass <code>extends</code> parentClass{
      <code>constructor</code>(properties){ <code>super</code>(properties);
      <code>this.</code> = properties; } }
    </li>
    <li>The <mark><code>extends</code></mark> keyword makes the methods of the animal class available inside the cat class.</li>
    <li>The <mark><code>super</code></mark> keyword calls the constructor of the parent class. In this case, super(properties) passes the properties argument of the child class to the constructor of the parent class. When the parent constructor runs, it sets this._properties =properties; for new child instances.</li>
    <li>In a constructor(), you must always call the super method before you can use the this keyword — if you do not, JavaScript will throw a reference error. To avoid reference errors, it is best practice to call super on the first line of subclass constructors.</li>
    <li>Child class may have unique properties and set it to the child constructor.</li>
  </ul>
