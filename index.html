  <h1>Classes</h1>
  <h2>Inheritance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When multiple classes share properties or methods, they become candidates
      for inheritance â€” a tool developers use to decrease the amount of code
      they need to write.
    </li>
    <li>
      With inheritance, you can create a parent class (also known as a
      superclass) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also
      known as subclasses) share.
    </li>
    <li>
      The child classes inherit the properties and methods from their parent
      class.
    </li>
